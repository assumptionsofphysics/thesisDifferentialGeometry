\chapter{Mathematical representation of physical objects}



\section{Manifolds and continuous quantities}
\emph{We tell physical objects apart by identifying some measurable properties. In particular, we are interested in properties that are continuous quantities. This gives us manifolds.}

\subsection{Physical objects and quantities}

- \emph{There is a physical object that we want to identify}

Say we're looking at weather. We'll want to know the temperature, wind speed, humidity, whereabouts, etc.

- \emph{We can give real number values describing that object. This gives us quantities}

Fahrenheit, mph, percent humidity, location.
On some set of all possible weather configurations, we look at a specific subset of possibilities described by real numbers. This is our weather report.  

Talking about location on the earth, a \textbf{single space cannot cover the entire earth such that a consistent set of quantities will be defined}. The poles must be in two separate subsets, with separate quantities. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{quantity} is a function $q : U \to \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a measurable value to a physical object.
\end{defn}


- \emph{Having a set of one-to-one quantities sufficient to distinguish one object from another, but not so many that some end up redundant, gives us a coordinate system}


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate system} $Q$ is a collection of $n$ quantities $q^i : U \to \mathbb{R}$ such that there is a one-to-one relationship between the physical objects in $U$ and elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}


- \emph{\textbf{Overlapping} coordinate systems can be transformed between}

Moscow may be seen on both a map of Europe and a map of Asia, so its coordinate system can be swapped. Lisbon, however, will not show up on a map of Asia, so its coordinate system cannot be swapped.

\node[roundnode]	(U) {U};
\node[roundnode]	(V) [below=of U]{V};
\node[squarednode]	(realU) [right=of U] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};
\node[squarednode]	(realV) [right=of V] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};

\draw[<->] (U) -- (realU) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[<->] (U) -- (V) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (V) -- (realV) node[midway, below] {$P$};
\draw[<->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{defn}
	Given two coordinate systems  $Q : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $P : V \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, we call a \textbf{coordinate transformation} the function $f = P \circ (Q)^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}




- \emph{Now that we have sets that can be mapped to the real numbers, we can define manifolds}

For the weather example, a manifold would be all possible weather conditions (including things that can't necessarily be quantified, like the color of a sunset), with a subsection whereon is defined a weather report, measuring temperature, wind speed, etc. in different places. If we're looking to parametrize the entire earth, then our manifold cannot be covered with a single subset, because the earth is roughly a sphere. We will need multiple subsets to cover all of the earth, and all possible weather conditions. 


 
\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{manifold} is a set of physical objects $X$ such that for any $x \in X$ there exists a $U \subset X$ that contains $x$ and upon which a coordinate system $Q$ is defined.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	For a given manifold X, a collection of quantities defined such that the subsets spanning X each have quantities are called the \textbf{atlases} of X. 
\end{defn}



\subsection{Sub-manifolds and k-surfaces}

- \emph{Within a manifold can lie a manifold of equal or smaller dimension, with a mapping between them}

If in the original weather report we were worrying about temperature, humidity, and wind speed, we could instead hold one of the three values fixed (say, humidity), and vary the other two. The latter manifold, with humidity held constant, would be a sub-manifold of the former, where all three variables are allowed to change.  



\begin{defn}
	Consider a manifold X of dimension n, and a manifold Y of dimension k, such that $k \leq n$. Y is a \textbf{submanifold} or a k-surface of X if any point on Y is also a point on X. 
\end{defn}

- parameterization of Y can be done in terms of the coordinates of X; $q^i(p^j)$



\begin{coro}
	Suppose we have a manifold X of dimension n, with a submanifold Y of dimension k, such that $k \leq n$. Therefore, the coordinate transformation from X to Y will be onto, while the coordinate transformation from Y to X will be one-to-one. 
\end{coro}


TODO: \emph{Make more explicit in this picture the one-way arrow between X and Y.}

\begin{tikzpicture}
[roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
\node[roundnode]	(X) {X};
\node[roundnode]	(Y) [below=of X]{Y};
\node[squarednode]	(realX) [right=of X] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};
\node[squarednode]	(realY) [right=of Y] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};

\draw[<->] (X) -- (realX) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[->] (X) -- (Y) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (Y) -- (realY) node[midway, below] {$P$};
\draw[->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}

-What are the possible submanifolds of a given manifold?


\begin{defn}
	For some manifold X of dimension n, $S^k$ is the set of all possible \textbf{k-surfaces}, or sub-manifolds of dimension $k \leq n$. 
\end{defn}

- \emph{A manifold of dimension n can have a boundary of dimension n-1. The boundary itself will not have a boundary.}

The boundary of a weather report would be readings restricted to a specific climate. 


\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma \in S^k$, if for some point $x \in \sigma$ you can construct a open neighborhood around x completely within $\sigma$, then x is an \textbf{interior point} of $\sigma$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma \in S^k$, if some point $x \in \sigma$ is not an interior point, then $x$ is a \textbf{boundary point}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma \in S^k$, $\partial\sigma \in S^{k-1}$ is the set of all boundary points of $\sigma$, or, the \textbf{boundary} of $\sigma$. 
\end{defn}

- \emph{Dimension is one less since at each section of the boundary, one of the dimensions must be held fixed. }

- \emph{$\partial\partial\sigma$ is empty since all points on the boundary are interior with respect to the boundary}


\begin{coro}
	Given $\sigma \in S^k$, $\partial\sigma \in S^{k-1}$, and $\partial\partial\sigma = \emptyset$. 
\end{coro}


- The boundary appears to be very similar to a line, in that all points on the boundary are interior with respect to the boundary. 

- For a cube, the boundary will suffer discontinuities due to the corners. This is ok, since there are a countable number of discontinuities. 

\subsection{Linear Functionals of K-surfaces}

TODO: Clean up the definitions here

\begin{defn}
	S $=$ $\cup^n_{k=0}S^k$ is the set of all k-surfaces. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{linear function of k-surfaces}, or \textbf{k-functional}, is a function $f : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2 \in S^k$, if $\sigma_1 \cap \sigma_2 \subseteq \partial\sigma_1 \cup \partial\sigma_2$, then $f(\sigma_1\cup\sigma_2) = f(\sigma_1) + f(\sigma_2)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$F = \cup_{k=0}^nF_k$ is the set of all k-functionals. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\Delta : F_k \to F_{k+1}$ is the \textbf{exterior derivative on k-functionals}. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	Given $f : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f(\partial\sigma^{k+1}) = \Delta f(\sigma^{k+1})$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{prop}
	A k-functional applied to the empty set gives zero. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $f : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear function. Consider the empty set $\emptyset$. 
We have $\emptyset \cap \emptyset \subseteq \partial\emptyset \cup \partial\emptyset$, and $\emptyset = \emptyset\cup\emptyset$. 
So, $f(\emptyset) = f(\emptyset\cup\emptyset) = f(\emptyset) + f(\emptyset) \implies f(\emptyset) = 2f(\emptyset) \implies f(\emptyset) = 0$
\end{proof}


\begin{defn}
	For $f : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ and k-surface $\sigma$, we say that $\partial f(\sigma) \equiv f(\partial\sigma)$. 
\end{defn}


\begin{prop}
	Let $f \in F_k$ be a k-functional, then $\partial\partial f = 0 $.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

	Let $f : S^k \to \mathbb{R}, g : S^{k+1} \to \mathbb{R},$ and $h : S^{k+2} \to \mathbb{R}$ be linear functions, and let $\sigma$ be an element of $S^k$. $h(\sigma) = g(\partial\sigma) = f(\partial\partial\sigma) = f(\emptyset) = 0$. 
	
	So, $h(\sigma) = 0$ $\forall$ $\sigma$, and h is the zero function. 
\end{proof}






\chapter{Mathematical representation of infinitesimal objects}

TODO: Expand the justification of "for k-surface..." below here

\section{Differentiable manifolds and densities}


- For k-surface $\sigma \in S^k$ and k-functional $F: S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $F(\sigma) = \int_{\sigma}f(d\sigma)$. 

We are interested in studying distribution on manifolds. Talk about them as a measure. The limit on infinitesimal areas is a density and requires coordinates to be differentiable.


\begin{defn}
	Given some manifold $X$ of dimension $n$, with overlapping subsets $U$ and $V$ with defined coordinate systems $Q: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $P: V \to \mathbb{R}^n$, if the coordinate transformation $f = Q \circ P^{-1}$ is smooth, then $X$ is a \textbf{differentiable manifold}. 
\end{defn}





\section{Vectors and infinitesimal displacements}

- For a given line, a vector will be an infinitesimal displacement along that line. 

- For a surface, a vector will be an infinitesimal displacement along the tangent plane. 


Consider a point P($x^a$).
 
$dP = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a} dx^a = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^b} dx^b = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a}\frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b} dx^b$

$\implies dx^a = \frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b}dx^b $


\begin{defn}
	The \textbf{tangent plane} $T_p$ of some point P(x) is the set of tangent vectors at P(x). 
\end{defn}
 
\begin{defn}
	For k-surface $\sigma \in S^k$, $d : S^k \to V^k$ will give the tangent plane of $\sigma$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Given vectors $X^a$ in the coordinate system $x^a$ and $X'^a$ in coordinate system $x'^a$, $X^a$ and $X'^a$ can be transformed between as $X'^a = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^b} X^b$. 
\end{defn}



\section{Multivectors and Clifford Algebra}

\emph{Note that electrodynamics has been reworked in the language of multivectors. Probably a good example to use}

\subsection{Multivectors}

- We want to be able to give a line, surface, body, etc. an orientation. This gives us multivectors. Talk also about their relationship to k-forms. 

\subsection{Operations between multivectors}

- Here we will be talking about inner and outer products, and how they behave with multivectors of different degrees. Maybe move the wedge product definition up here? 

\subsection{Clifford Algebra}

- Define the Clifford product, and talk about \emph{cliffors} as combinations of multivectors of varying degrees 


\section{Covectors and linear functions of displacements}

For some line P, $\int df(P)$ = $\int \frac{\partial f(P)}{{\partial x^i}} dx^i$ = $\int \frac{{\partial f(P)}}{{\partial x^i}} e^i (dx^j e_j)$

We can define functions that convert infinitesimal displacements to a scalar value. 




\section{Tensors and coordinate transformations}
Some quantities can undergo one-to-one transformations between coordinate systems. In general, such quantities are tensors. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{tensor} is an object with a one-to-one relationship with objects between coordinate systems. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as  $X'^a = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^b} X^b$.  
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A covariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as $X'_a = \frac{\partial x^b}{\partial x'^a} X_b$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 2} is a matrix $X^{ab}$ that transforms as $X'^{ab} = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^c} \frac{\partial x'^b}{\partial x^d} X^{cd}$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 0} is a quantity $X$ that transforms $X' = X$. That is, a scalar. 
\end{coro}

- In general, objects associated with covariant tensors will have a lower index, and those associated with contravariant tensors will have an upper index. 

\section{K-forms and wedge product}




\begin{defn}
	A linear function may be defined \textbf{infinitesimally}, such that $F : S^k \to \mathbb{R} = \int_{\sigma} f(d\sigma)$. Further, for $G : S^{k+1} \to \mathbb{R}$, $G(\sigma) = \int_{\sigma} g(d\sigma) = F(\partial\sigma) = \int_{\partial\sigma}f(d\partial\sigma)$. 
\end{defn}

In more abstract or complicated coordinate systems, it becomes useful to define geometry on infinitesimal displacements. 

- \emph{We want to be able to describe displacements and functions along them independent of coordinate system. This gives us differential forms}


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differential} such as dx, dy, dz describes an infinitesimal displacement along a coordinate axis. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-form} $f_k : V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a skew-symmetric covariant linear functional. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms of dimension k. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\Omega = \cup_{k=0}^n\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms. 
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	
	The \textbf{outer product} $\wedge : \Omega_k \times \Omega_j \to \Omega_{k+j}$ combines forms. 
\end{defn}





\chapter{Geometry and (States, Tensors, Forms)???}


\subsection{Metric tensor}
A more generalized inner product: feed in two vectors, and the outcome is a scalar representing the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{metric tensor g} is a function that takes two vectors and returns a real scalar. 
\end{defn}


\section{Riemannian geometry}
In order to give a mathematically rigorous definition of lengths of vectors and the angle between them, we use an inner product. Vector spaces with an inner product are Riemannian.

\begin{defn}
	Given two vectors $X^a,Y^a \in V$ and a metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the \textbf{inner product} $<X^a,Y^a> : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as $<X^a,Y^a> = g_{ab}X^aY^b$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The magnitude of $<u,v>$ is $|u||v|cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between u and v. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	If a vector space V contains an inner product, then V is \textbf{Riemannian}.
	\end{defn}



\subsection{Orthogonal basis}

\begin{defn}
	For contravariant vectors $X^a$ and $Y^a$, the two vectors are \textbf{orthogonal} if $<X^a,Y^b> = 0$. 
\end{defn}

\section{Symplectic geometry and state spaces}
We want to be able to represent our state configurations. Symplectic geometry arises when trying to describe their areas

\subsection{Symplectic form and areas}
Just as the metric tensor lets us define length and angles, the symplectic form lets us define areas.
