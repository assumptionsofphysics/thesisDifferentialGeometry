\section{Foreword}
In transitioning to more advanced classes, the physics student will find their familiar mathematical tools are inadequate to describe certain physical phenomena. The methods of traditional vector calculus in three dimensions, though very useful in Electromagnetism and Classical Mechanics, are not always usable in higher dimensions, such as those used in General Relativity. For that, we need differential geometry. When trying to learn a subject in mathematics, however, you tend to find books written for mathematicians. As such, they are filled with long, obtuse definitions and prose that, while mathematically very precise, isn't exactly light reading. 

What follows is a purely physical treatment of differential geometry used in physics. While it is less mathematically rigorous than a typical textbook, the hope is that the reader will be able to gain a geometric intuition for the math they use, so that the math isn't simply a black box beyond understanding, and that further study in the subject will be aided by a solid grounding here. The focus is always on readability, applicability, and physicality, so pictures are prevalent (\textbf{\textit{Will} be prevalent}).

\chapter{Mathematical representations of physical objects}



\section{Physical objects and quantities}

At the heart of scientific investigation is the identifying and organizing of objects based on their properties, through measurement and experiment. This could be as simple as setting a block on a scale to determine its weight, or as complex as determining which economic policies lead to a recession. For our purposes here, we will be dealing only with properties that can be described using real numbers, such as mass, temperature, velocity, etc. The identification of a particular physical property with a real number is a \textbf{quantity}.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{quantity} is a function $q : U \to \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a measurable value to a physical object.
\end{defn}



It's quite possible, however, that we won't be able to distinguish between two objects with only one quantity. Say, for instance, that we're talking about weather. Knowing what the temperature will be tomorrow is certainly useful, but as anyone from Florida can tell you, 80$^o$F with 95$\%$ humidity is very different than 80$^o$F with 30$\%$ humidity. In distinguishing objects, then, we will often want to define more than one quantity, to give an even more descriptive way of categorizing objects. By defining enough quantities to distinguish one object from another, but not so many such that we have redundancies, we can define a \textbf{coordinate system}.

Normally, we think of coordinate systems in the context of quantifying an object's position, in terms of its x-, y-, and z-coordinates, but this is by no means the only context that coordinate systems arise in. Consider, for instance, phase space. Configurations of a state can be distinguished by position as well as by momentum, which would be our two quantities, thus giving us a coordinate system. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate system} $Q$ is a collection of $n$ quantities $q^i : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that there is a one-to-one relationship between the physical objects in $U$ and elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}





\textbf{Use the word atlas with different charts. Also, while working through the text, try to sketch pictures to demonstrate concepts. Try to talk about with A5 B7 D3 kind of atlas}
With coordinate systems defined now, we must recognize that in many instances, two different coordinate systems function just as well to describe a certain object. \textbf{Reword being specific of sets} Mathematically, this occurs when two sets, each with defined coordinate systems, overlap. The points that lie within this overlapping section may be described in either coordinate system. To give an example from geography, consider the "point" Moscow. It could very well show up on a map of Asia, with specific x and y coordinates, while also showing up on a map of Europe, with different, but equally valid x and y coordinates. Therefore, Moscow's position is described just as well on either map, and so its position can be freely transformed from one coordinate system to another. Alternatively, consider the "point" Lisbon. Lisbon will show up on a map of Europe, with valid x and y coordinates, but you would never find Lisbon on a map of Asia. Therefore, its position may only be described in terms of the coordinates on the map of Europe.


\begin{defn}
	Given two coordinate systems  $Q : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q' : V \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, we call a \textbf{coordinate transformation} the function $f = Q' \circ (Q)^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}



\textbf{May have to describe the meaning of the diagram, reader might not know. Or take it out}

\end{tikzpicture}


\textbf{This paragraph doesnt follow. Be specific with what Im trying to talk about}
So, we now have a notion of sets that may be mapped to the real numbers. This allows us to define one of the most important tools in mathematical physics: the \textbf{manifold.}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{manifold} is a set of physical objects $X$ such that for any $x \in X$ there exists a $U \subset X$ that contains $x$ and upon which a coordinate system $Q$ is defined.
\end{defn}

\textbf{Not a set of physical objects, a set of possible states}
Earlier, weather was given as an example of a set of physical objects (\textbf{specify above that weather would be a set of physical objects}), with readings such as temperature and humidity allowing us to define a coordinate system. In this context, the "manifold" would be a full weather report (\textbf{no, its the set of weather configurations}) 

The Earth is a classic example of a manifold, which allows for further discussion of the geography example. Because of the poles, every location on earth cannot be quantified with only one set of coordinates. (\textbf{Elaborate})
 

\textbf{Analogy: The }

\section{Sub-manifolds and k-surfaces}

- \emph{Within a manifold can lie a manifold of equal or smaller dimension, with a mapping between them}

\textbf{Reword first sentence. Definitely talk about classifying submaniflds based on their dimensionality. K-surfaces have k-freedoms. Boundaries occur where the varying is stopped}
A manifold may be a subset of another larger manifold, which may have more quantities, simply more points, etc. Back to the weather example, if in the original weather report we were worrying about temperature, humidity, and wind speed, we could instead hold one of the three values fixed (say, humidity), and vary the other two. The latter manifold, with humidity held constant, would be a \textbf{submanifold} of the former, where all three variables are allowed to change.


\begin{defn}
	Consider a manifold X of dimension n, and a manifold Y of dimension k, such that $k \leq n$. Y is a \textbf{submanifold} or a \textbf{k-surface} of X if any point on Y is also a point on X. 
\end{defn}

\begin{tikzpicture}
[roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
\node[roundnode]	(X) {X};
\node[roundnode]	(Y) [below=of X]{Y};
\node[squarednode]	(realX) [right=of X] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};
\node[squarednode]	(realY) [right=of Y] {$\mathbb{R}^k$};

\draw[<->] (X) -- (realX) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[->] (X) -- (Y) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (Y) -- (realY) node[midway, below] {$P$};
\draw[->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}

In general, we will be using the term "k-surface", instead of "submanifold." 


\begin{defn}
	For some manifold X of dimension n, $S^k$ is the set of all possible \textbf{k-surfaces}, or sub-manifolds of dimension $k \leq n$, and S $=$ $\cup^n_{k=0}S^k$ is the set of all k-surfaces. 
\end{defn}

\textbf{May not be able to talk about coordinate lines without defining manifolds. Maybe only the last sentence is the issue}
Though we can identify multiple quantities, it is still sometimes necessary to isolate specific quantities to identify their particular influence on a system. In an n-dimensional space, holding (n-1) quantities fixed and then allowing the nth quantity to vary would allow us to know specifically the effect that the nth quantity will have on the system, with the assurance that comes from knowing that all other factors are kept the same. \textbf{On our space, this varying quantity manifests itself as a line \textit{maybe get rid of this last sentence}, we may only need to talk about coordinate lines, and introduce also coordinate surfaces, volumes, etc. with submanifolds}. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate line} is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by allowing one quantity to vary and holding the others fixed. 
\end{defn}

\textbf{Replace this whole paragraph with the talk about limit points}
Now that we are able to define manifolds within manifolds, we have a notion of where a point lies relative to some manifold. Specifically, we are able to say whether a point is exterior to the k-surface, \textbf{interior} to the k-surface (that is, on the surface, and surrounded by points also on the surface), and on the \textbf{boundary} of the k-surface (lying on the "edge" of the surface).  


\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, if for some point $x \in \sigma^k$ you can construct a open neighborhood around x completely within $\sigma^k$, then x is an \textbf{interior point} of $\sigma^k$. 
\end{defn}


\textbf{Boundary points aren't relaly the points that aren't interior, they are the limit points that dont have an open set}
\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, if some point $x \in \sigma^k$ is not an interior point, then $x$ is a \textbf{boundary point}.
\end{defn}

Intuitively, we can talk about the boundary of a set being a wall, beyond which a particle confined to the set cannot go. Consider, for instance, a particle confined to the inside of a sphere. The particle is free to move anywhere within the sphere, but is stopped from leaving by the surface of the sphere itself. Thus, the surface is the boundary. On the other hand, consider a particle confined to the surface of a sphere. The particle can travel along the surface as long as it wants without being stopped by any kind of wall. Thus, the surface of a sphere does not have a boundary. 

Later on, it will become important to be able to concentrate entirely on the boundary of a k-surface. Therefore, we must make use of the \textbf{boundary operator} in order to go from a k-surface to it's boundary. 

\begin{defn}
	For k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, the \textbf{boundary operator} $\partial : S^k \to S^{k-1}$ gives the set of boundary points of $\sigma^k$. 
\end{defn}

The dimension of the boundary is one less than the dimension of the k-surface itself. To get an intuitive feel for why this must be so, consider a cube embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For a particle confined to the inside of the cube, the boundary of a cube would be its sides, because they stop movement out of the cube. So, consider the particle confined to the cube's boundaries: its sides. When the particle is moving along a side, one of the dimensions must be held fixed \textbf{include a picture here}, so the dimension of the boundary of a set is one less than the dimension of the set. 


The boundary of our weather report is a little more abstract. (\textbf{The boundary is a specific climate? But different climates can have the same weather depending on the day. })

Furthermore, $\partial\partial \sigma^k$ is empty. Consider once again a cube in $\mathbb{R}^3$. As stated before, the boundary of a cube is its sides. A particle confined to its sides can move in a straight line along the outside of the cube (switching sides as needed) forever, so there is no boundary. Note that a single side of the cube makes up only part of the boundary of the cube, 

\begin{coro}
	Given $\sigma^k \in S^k$, $\partial \sigma^k \in S^{k-1}$, and $\partial\partial \sigma^k = \emptyset$. 
\end{coro}


\section{Linear Functionals of K-surfaces}


\textbf{Extra condition, the length isnt a 1 form. The limit of alternating horizontal and vertical lines isn't the length of the diagonal. Length of limit isnt limit of length. So fix the definition. Maybe adding requirement of limit}
Now that we have discussed k-surfaces, we want to be able to have functions applied over them. We require that these functions be linear; that is, if two k-surfaces overlap only on their boundary, then applying a function over the two surfaces at once is equivalent to applying the function to each of them separately, and summing their contributions. We call linear functions of k-surfaces \textbf{k-functionals}. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{linear function of k-surfaces}, or \textbf{k-functional}, is a function $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for $\sigma^k_1$, $\sigma^k_2 \in S^k$, if $\sigma^k_1 \cap \sigma^k_2 \subseteq \partial \sigma^k_1 \cup \partial \sigma^k_2$, then $f_k(\sigma^k_1\cup \sigma^k_2) = f_k(\sigma^k_1) + f_k(\sigma^k_2)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$F_k$ is the set of all functionals of dimension k, and $F = \cup_{k=0}^nF_k$ is the set of all k-functionals. 
\end{defn}

In the previous section, we discussed the boundary operator as a map from a k-surface to its boundary. It's reasonable, then, that we ought to be able to use our k-functionals on the boundary. To do so, however, we need an operator on k-functionals that is equivalent to the boundary operator on k-surfaces. In complement to "boundary", we define the \textbf{interior functional} \textit{extend this paragraph to include the definition}

\begin{defn}
	$\eth : F_k \to F_{k+1}$ such that $\eth f_k(\sigma^{k+1}) = f_k(\partial \sigma^{k+1})$ is the \textbf{interior functional} on k-functionals. 
\end{defn}

Because applying the interior operator to a k-functional is equivalent to applying the boundary operator to a k-surface, it must be that properties of the boundary operator hold true for the interior operator. 

\begin{prop}
	A k-functional applied to the empty set gives zero. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	
	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear function. Consider the empty set $\emptyset$. 
We have $\emptyset \cap \emptyset \subseteq \partial\emptyset \cup \partial\emptyset$, and $\emptyset = \emptyset\cup\emptyset$. 
So, $f_k(\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset\cup\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset) + f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 2f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 0$
\end{proof}



\begin{prop}
	Let $f_k \in F_k$ be a k-functional, then $\eth\eth f_k = 0 $.
	
	
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $g_{k+1} : S^{k+1} \to \mathbb{R},$ and $h_{k+2}: S^{k+2} \to \mathbb{R}$ be linear functions, and let $\sigma^k$ be an element of $S^k$. $f_k(\sigma^k) = g_{k+1}(\partial \sigma^k) = h_{k+2}(\partial\partial \sigma^k) = f_k(\emptyset) = 0$. 
	
	So, $h^{k+2}(s) = 0$ $\forall$ $\sigma^k$, and $h^{k+2}$ is the zero function. 
\end{proof}

\section{Summary}


- \emph{Very much fix this summary. It's not terribly clear to an outside reader. Far too much stuff here, too much to digest. Coordinate lines and systems may not be necessary}
In mathematical science, our goal in general is to be able to assign a numerical value to a physical property of some object. This directly gives us \textbf{quantities} as functions that assign real values to physical objects. We then group quantities into sets, requiring those sets to be sufficient to distinguish one physical object from another (\textbf{states are in configurations, quantities identify a configuration}), and calling those sets \textbf{coordinate systems} (\textbf{need to connect audiennce's experience with coordinate with our own}). Varying a quantity while keeping the others fixed gives us \textbf{coordinate lines}, and because certain physical properties can be equally well described in different coordinate systems, we introduce \textbf{coordinate transformations}. (\textbf{A manifold is a set of things that can be distinguished through coordinate systems})All of these mathematical constructions together, along with the requirement that the set of possible measured values must be completely covered by subsets with defined quantities, gives us \textbf{manifolds}. 

\textbf{The k in k-surface isnt clear}
Within manifolds may lie smaller manifolds: \textbf{submanifolds}, or \textbf{k-surfaces}. Having a notion of certain points existing on a submanifold and certain points existing outside of it gives us the notion of the \textbf{interior} of a surface. The \textbf{boundary} of a surface follows naturally as being the set of points on that surface that are not on the interior (\textbf{we may not want to say that we have always submanifold with a boundary. Also someone may not even have clear what a surface is. }), and therewith also the \textbf{boundary operator}, which takes us from a k-surface to its boundary. 

\textbf{No sense of linearity defined yet. Need anew name for }
We now want to be able to talk about functions along our k-surfaces. We define then \textbf{k-functionals} as linear functions along our k-surfaces. Because of our requirement of linearity, we will be able to start talking about functions over infinitesimals in Chapter 2. Finally, we introduce the \textbf{interior functional}, which applied to a k-functional is equivalent to applying a boundary operator to a (k+1)-surface, and will allow us to talk about Stoke's Theorem in Chapter 2.  





\chapter{Mathematical representation of infinitesimal objects}


\section{Differentiable manifolds}

Now that we are able to represent functions along lines as sums of functions along segments, we can start doing calculus. 


- For k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$ and k-functional $f_k: S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k(\sigma^k) = \int_{\sigma^k}f_k(d\sigma^k)$. 

We are interested in studying distribution on manifolds. The limit on infinitesimal areas is a density and requires coordinates to be differentiable.


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differentiable manifold} is a manifold $X$ of dimension $n$ such that if there are overlapping subsets $U$ and $V$ with defined coordinate systems $Q: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q': V \to \mathbb{R}^n$, then the coordinate transformation $f = Q \circ Q'^{-1}$ is smooth. 
\end{defn}





\section{Vectors and Covectors}

- Starting with the 1D case: for a given line, a vector will be an infinitesimal segment along that line. 


Consider a point P($x^a$).
 
$dP = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a} dx^a = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^b} dx^b = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a}\frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b} dx^b$

$\implies dx^a = \frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b}dx^b $

\emph{Problem with this chain-rule formulation is that the vector isn't the infinitesimal segment}

\emph{Alternative formulation}
$dP = w^ue_u + w^ve_v$

\emph{With this, the infinitesimal segment is the vector, which is what we want in the end. Question remains whether we can still use a chain rule formulation to derive this}

This gives us vectors and covectors: the former being infinitesimal segments, and the latter being functions from vectors to real numbers



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{vector} $v^1 \in V^1$ is an infinitesimal segment along a line. A \textbf{tangent plane}, then, is a collection of vectors that share a fixed point. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{covector} $\omega_1 : V^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear function of vectors. 
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differential} $dx$ is the element of the tangent plane of a line which if summed at all points will return the line itself. 
\end{defn}

We can define functions that convert infinitesimal segments to a scalar value. 

For some line P, $\int df(P)$ = $\int \frac{\partial f(P)}{{\partial x^i}} dx^i$ = $\int \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial P}dP$ = $\int \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x^i}} e^i (dx^j e_j)$






\begin{prop}
	Every linear 1-functional has a corresponding covector, such that for $f : S \to \mathbb{R}$, $f = \int_{\lambda} \omega_1(d\lambda)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a line is the same as an integral of a covector over the infinitesimal segments of that line. 
\end{prop}





\section{K-vectors and K-forms}

\emph{Note that electrodynamics has been reworked in the language of k-vectors. Probably a good example to use}




\subsection{K-vectors}

- We want to be able to give a line, surface, body, etc. an orientation. This gives us k-vectors.

- Further, we're now talking about vectors and covectors in arbitrary dimensions

- Here we will be talking about wedge products, and how they behave with k-vectors of different degrees. 



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-vector} $v^k \in V^k$ is an infinitesimal parallelepiped on a k-surface. A vector as discussed previously is a 1-vector. A \textbf{tangent space} is then a collection of k-vectors that share a fixed corner. 
\end{defn}

- \emph{Talking about orientation in terms of quantities: if we flip a quantity, we flip the orientation. Also, it should follow naturally that adding k-vectors of equal magnitude and opposite orientation will give zero.}



\begin{defn}
	$V^k$ is the set of all vectors of rank k and $V = \cup_{k=0}^n V^k$ is the set of all k-vectors. 
	\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	
	The \textbf{wedge product} $\wedge : V^k\times V^j \to V^{k+j}$ combines k-vectors antisymmetrically to generate parallelepipeds. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The orientation of each side of the parallelepiped is different, as determined by the factors in the wedge product. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-form} $\omega_k : V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a skew-symmetric linear functional that converts an infinitesimal parallelepiped into a scalar value. A covector as discussed previously is a 1-form. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms of dimension k and $\Omega = \cup_{k=0}^n\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	Every linear k-functional has a corresponding k-form, such that for $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k = \int_{\sigma^k} \omega_k(d\sigma^k)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a k-surface is the same as an integral of a k-form over the infinitesimal parallelepipedes of that k-surface. 
\end{prop}

\section{Coordinates and components?}

Let $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment that starts at a point $P$. Then the coordinate differences $dx^i$ uniquely identifies $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $d\lambda = dx^i \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial x^i} = dx^i e_i$ where $e_i$ gives us the infinitesimal segment along the coordinate lines of $x^i$.

Let $\omega$ be a covector and $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment. Then $\omega(d\lambda)$ is a linear function of the coordinate differences along $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $\omega = \omega_i \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \lambda} = \omega_i e^i$ where each $e^i$ is the covector that returns the coordinate difference along the $x^i$ coordinate. In fact, $e^i(d\lambda) = e^i(dx^j e_j) = dx^j e^i(e_j) = dx^j \delta^i_j = dx^i$.


Therefore, for infinitesimal segment d$\lambda$ and k-form $\omega$, $\omega(d\lambda) = \omega_ie^i(dx^je_j) = \omega_idx^je^ie_j = \omega_idx^j\delta^i_j = \omega_i dx^i$ 

\section{Stoke's Theorem}



\begin{defn}
	$\eth : \Omega_k \to \Omega_{k+1}$ is the \textbf{exterior derivative} on k-forms, such that for k-surface $\sigma$ and (k-1)-functional $f$ with associated (k-1)-form $\omega$, 
	
	$f$($\sigma$) = $\int_{\sigma}\omega(d\sigma)$ and $\eth f(\sigma) = f(\partial\sigma)$
	
	$\implies \eth f(\sigma) = \int_{\partial\sigma} \omega(d\partial\sigma) = \int_{\sigma} \eth\omega(d\sigma)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	\textbf{Stoke's Theorem}: For (k-1)-form $\omega$ and k-surface $\sigma$, $\int_{\partial \sigma}\omega = \int_{\sigma}\eth\omega$. 
\end{defn}

NOTE: It seems that we don't even needs to worry about orientation as long as we're in coordinate free space. If possible, it would be cool to be able to not talk about orientation at all. It's just a choice of sign on both the direction of integration and the k-form. We can show that changing the sign of the integration necessitates also changing the sign of the k-form, thus making the orientation itself unnecessary (may not be needed). "suppose that you have a k-form, and you have chosen your coordinates, you can switch the order of integration and put a minus on the form, but then components of hte form change, so the form has different components dependign on orientation." "Or, we can say that there is some coordinate for which we go from a to be and others from b to a, components are thus the same, coordinates are different, but make up a class. It's just a different way to keep track of the sign." Components flip sign under a mirror, or flip, or whatever. 

NOTE: If we can stay coordinate free up until this point, maybe we can start talking about coordinates here in the coordinate transformation section
\section{Tensors and coordinate transformations}
Some quantities can undergo one-to-one transformations between coordinate systems. In general, such quantities are tensors. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{tensor} is an object with a one-to-one relationship with objects between coordinate systems. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as  $X'^a = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^b} X^b$.  
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A covariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as $X'_a = \frac{\partial x^b}{\partial x'^a} X_b$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 2} is a matrix $X^{ab}$ that transforms as $X'^{ab} = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^c} \frac{\partial x'^b}{\partial x^d} X^{cd}$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 0} is a quantity $X$ that transforms $X' = X$. Hence, a scalar. 
\end{coro}

- In general, objects associated with covariant tensors will have a lower index, and those associated with contravariant tensors will have an upper index.

\section{Symplectic geometry and state spaces}
We want to be able to represent our state configurations. Symplectic geometry arises when trying to describe their areas

\subsection{Symplectic form and areas}



\subsection{Metric tensor}
A more generalized inner product: feed in two vectors, and the outcome is a scalar representing the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{metric tensor g} is a function that takes two vectors and returns a real scalar. 
\end{defn}


\section{Riemannian geometry}
In order to give a mathematically rigorous definition of lengths of vectors and the angle between them, we use an inner product. Vector spaces with an inner product are Riemannian.

\begin{defn}
	Given two vectors $X^a,Y^a \in V$ and a metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the \textbf{inner product} $<X^a,Y^a> : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as $<X^a,Y^a> = g_{ab}X^aY^b$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The magnitude of $<u,v>$ is $|u||v|cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between u and v. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	If a vector space V contains an inner product, then V is \textbf{Riemannian}.
	\end{defn}



\subsection{Orthogonal basis}

\begin{defn}
	For contravariant vectors $X^a$ and $Y^a$, the two vectors are \textbf{orthogonal} if $<X^a,Y^b> = 0$. 
\end{defn}
