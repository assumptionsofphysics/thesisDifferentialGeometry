\chapter{Mathematical representations of physical objects}


\section{Manifolds and continuous quantities}

\subsection{Summary}

In mathematical science, our goal in general is to be able to assign a numerical value to a physical property of some object. This directly gives us \textbf{quantities} as functions that assign real values to physical objects. We then group quantities into sets, requiring those sets to be sufficient to distinguish one physical object from another, and calling those sets \textbf{coordinate systems}. Varying a quantity while keeping the others fixed gives us \textbf{coordinate lines}, and because certain physical properties can be equally well described in different coordinate systems, we introduce \textbf{coordinate transformations}. All of these mathematical constructions together, along with the requirement that the set of possible measured values must be completely covered by subsets with defined quantities, gives us \textbf{manifolds}. 

Within manifolds may lie smaller manifolds: \textbf{submanifolds}, or \textbf{k-surfaces}. Having a notion of certain points existing on a submanifold and certain points existing outside of it gives us the notion of the \textbf{interior} of a surface. The \textbf{boundary} of a surface follows naturally as being the set of points on that surface that are not on the interior, and therewith also the \textbf{boundary operator}, which takes us from a k-surface to its boundary. 

We now want to be able to talk about functions along our k-surfaces. We define then \textbf{k-functionals} as linear functions along our k-surfaces. Because of our requirement of linearity, we will be able to start talking about functions over infinitesimals in Chapter 2. Finally, we introduce the \textbf{interior operator}, which applied to a k-functional is equivalent to applying a boundary operator to a (k+1)-surface, and will allow us to talk about Stoke's Theorem in Chapter 2.  


\subsection{Physical objects and quantities}

At the heart of investigation in science is the identifying and organizing of objects based on their properties, through measurement and experiment. This could be as simple as setting a block on a scale to determine its weight, or as complex as determining which economic policies lead to a recession. For our purposes here, we will be dealing only with properties that can be described using real numbers, such as mass, temperature, velocity, etc. The identification of a particular physical property with a real number is called a \textbf{quantity}.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{quantity} is a function $q : U \to \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a measurable value to a physical object.
\end{defn}

\emph{Say we're looking at weather. We'll want to know the temperature, wind speed, humidity, whereabouts, etc.
Fahrenheit, mph, percent humidity, location.
On some set of all possible weather configurations, we look at a specific subset of possibilities described by real numbers. This is our weather report.  }

It's quite possible, however, that we won't be able to distinguish between two objects with only one quantity. Say, for instance, that we're talking about weather. Knowing what the temperature will be tomorrow is certainly useful, but as anyone from Florida can tell you, 80$^o$F with 95$\%$ humidity is very different than 80$^o$F with 30$\%$ humidity. In distinguishing objects, then, we will often want to define more than one quantity, to give an even more descriptive way of categorizing objects: the \textbf{coordinate system}.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate system} $Q$ is a collection of $n$ quantities $q^i : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that there is a one-to-one relationship between the physical objects in $U$ and elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}

Though we can identify multiple quantities, it is still sometimes necessary to isolate specific quantities to identify their particular influence on a system. In an n-dimensional space, holding (n-1) quantities fixed and then allowing the nth quantity to vary would allow us to know specifically the effect that the nth quantity will have on the system, with the assurance that comes from knowing that all other factors are kept the same. On our coordinate system, this varying quantity manifests itself as a line. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate line} is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by allowing one quantity to vary and holding the others fixed. 
\end{defn}

With coordinate systems defined now, we must recognize that in many instances, two different coordinate systems function just as well to describe a certain object. Mathematically, this occurs when two sets, each with defined coordinate systems, overlap. The points that lie within this overlapping section may be described in either coordinate system. To give an example from geography, consider the "point" Moscow. It could very well show up on a map of Asia, with specific x and y coordinates, while also showing up on a map of Europe, with different, but equally valid x and y coordinates. Therefore, Moscow's position is described just as well on either map, and so its position can be freely transformed from one coordinate system to another. Alternatively, consider the "point" Lisbon. Lisbon will show up on a map of Europe, with valid x and y coordinates, but you would never find Lisbon on a map of Asia. Therefore, its position may only be described in terms of the coordinates on the map of Europe.


\begin{defn}
	Given two coordinate systems  $Q : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q' : V \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, we call a \textbf{coordinate transformation} the function $f = Q' \circ (Q)^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}


\begin{tikzpicture}
[roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
\node[roundnode]	(U) {U};
\node[roundnode]	(V) [below=of U]{V};
\node[squarednode]	(realU) [right=of U] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};
\node[squarednode]	(realV) [right=of V] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};

\draw[<->] (U) -- (realU) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[<->] (U) -- (V) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (V) -- (realV) node[midway, below] {$Q'$};
\draw[<->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}



So, we now have a notion of sets that may be mapped to the real numbers. This allows us to define one of the most important tools in mathematical physics: the \textbf{manifold.}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{manifold} is a set of physical objects $X$ such that for any $x \in X$ there exists a $U \subset X$ that contains $x$ and upon which a coordinate system $Q$ is defined.
\end{defn}

Earlier, weather was given as an example of a set of physical objects (\textbf{specify above that weather would be a set of physical objects}), with readings such as temperature and humidity allowing us to define a coordinate system. In this context, the "manifold" would be a full weather report (\textbf{clarify this example}) 

The Earth is a classic example of a manifold, which allows for further discussion of the geography example. Because of the poles, every location on earth cannot be quantified with only one set of coordinates. (\textbf{Elaborate})
 



\subsection{Sub-manifolds and k-surfaces}

- \emph{Within a manifold can lie a manifold of equal or smaller dimension, with a mapping between them}

A manifold may be a subset of another larger manifold, which may have more quantities, simply more points, etc. Back to the weather example, if in the original weather report we were worrying about temperature, humidity, and wind speed, we could instead hold one of the three values fixed (say, humidity), and vary the other two. The latter manifold, with humidity held constant, would be a \textbf{submanifold} of the former, where all three variables are allowed to change.  


\begin{defn}
	Consider a manifold X of dimension n, and a manifold Y of dimension k, such that $k \leq n$. Y is a \textbf{submanifold} or a \textbf{k-surface} of X if any point on Y is also a point on X. 
\end{defn}

\begin{tikzpicture}
[roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
\node[roundnode]	(X) {X};
\node[roundnode]	(Y) [below=of X]{Y};
\node[squarednode]	(realX) [right=of X] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};
\node[squarednode]	(realY) [right=of Y] {$\mathbb{R}^k$};

\draw[<->] (X) -- (realX) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[->] (X) -- (Y) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (Y) -- (realY) node[midway, below] {$P$};
\draw[->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}

In general, we will be using the term "k-surface", instead of "submanifold." 


\begin{defn}
	For some manifold X of dimension n, $S^k$ is the set of all possible \textbf{k-surfaces}, or sub-manifolds of dimension $k \leq n$, and S $=$ $\cup^n_{k=0}S^k$ is the set of all k-surfaces. 
\end{defn}

A manifold of dimension n can have a boundary of dimension n-1. The boundary itself will not have a boundary.

The boundary of a weather report would be readings restricted to a specific climate. 


\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, if for some point $x \in \sigma^k$ you can construct a open neighborhood around x completely within $\sigma^k$, then x is an \textbf{interior point} of $\sigma^k$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, if some point $x \in \sigma^k$ is not an interior point, then $x$ is a \textbf{boundary point}.
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	For k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, the \textbf{boundary operator} $\partial : S^k \to S^{k-1}$ gives the set of boundary points of $\sigma^k$. 
\end{defn}


Dimension is one less since at each section of the boundary, one of the dimensions must be held fixed.

$\partial\partial \sigma^k$ is empty since all points on the boundary are interior with respect to the boundary.


\begin{coro}
	Given $\sigma^k \in S^k$, $\partial \sigma^k \in S^{k-1}$, and $\partial\partial \sigma^k = \emptyset$. 
\end{coro}


NOTE: The boundary appears to be very similar to a line, in that all points on the boundary are interior with respect to the boundary. 

For a cube, the boundary will suffer discontinuities due to the corners. This is ok, since there are a countable number of discontinuities. 

\subsection{Linear Functionals of K-surfaces}

We have the tools now to begin talking about functions along our k-surfaces. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{linear function of k-surfaces}, or \textbf{k-functional}, is a function $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for $\sigma^k_1$, $\sigma^k_2 \in S^k$, if $\sigma^k_1 \cap \sigma^k_2 \subseteq \partial \sigma^k_1 \cup \partial \sigma^k_2$, then $f_k(\sigma^k_1\cup \sigma^k_2) = f_k(\sigma^k_1) + f_k(\sigma^k_2)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$F_k$ is the set of all functionals of dimension k, and $F = \cup_{k=0}^nF_k$ is the set of all k-functionals. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	$\eth : F_k \to F_{k+1}$ such that $\eth f_k(\sigma^{k+1}) = f_k(\partial \sigma^{k+1})$ is the \textbf{interior operator} on k-functionals. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	A k-functional applied to the empty set gives zero. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	
	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear function. Consider the empty set $\emptyset$. 
We have $\emptyset \cap \emptyset \subseteq \partial\emptyset \cup \partial\emptyset$, and $\emptyset = \emptyset\cup\emptyset$. 
So, $f_k(\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset\cup\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset) + f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 2f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 0$
\end{proof}



\begin{prop}
	Let $f_k \in F_k$ be a k-functional, then $\eth\eth f_k = 0 $.
	
	
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}


	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $g_{k+1} : S^{k+1} \to \mathbb{R},$ and $h_{k+2}: S^{k+2} \to \mathbb{R}$ be linear functions, and let $\sigma^k$ be an element of $S^k$. $f_k(\sigma^k) = g_{k+1}(\partial \sigma^k) = h_{k+2}(\partial\partial \sigma^k) = f_k(\emptyset) = 0$. 
	
	So, $h^{k+2}(s) = 0$ $\forall$ $\sigma^k$, and $h^{k+2}$ is the zero function. 
\end{proof}







\chapter{Mathematical representation of infinitesimal objects}


\section{Differentiable manifolds}

Now that we are able to represent functions along lines as sums of functions along segments, we can start doing calculus. 


- For k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$ and k-functional $f_k: S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k(\sigma^k) = \int_{\sigma^k}f_k(d\sigma^k)$. 

We are interested in studying distribution on manifolds. The limit on infinitesimal areas is a density and requires coordinates to be differentiable.


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differentiable manifold} is a manifold $X$ of dimension $n$ such that if there are overlapping subsets $U$ and $V$ with defined coordinate systems $Q: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q': V \to \mathbb{R}^n$, then the coordinate transformation $f = Q \circ Q'^{-1}$ is smooth. 
\end{defn}





\section{Vectors and Covectors}

- Starting with the 1D case: for a given line, a vector will be an infinitesimal segment along that line. 


Consider a point P($x^a$).
 
$dP = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a} dx^a = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^b} dx^b = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a}\frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b} dx^b$

$\implies dx^a = \frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b}dx^b $

\emph{Problem with this chain-rule formulation is that the vector isn't the infinitesimal segment}

\emph{Alternative formulation}
$dP = w^ue_u + w^ve_v$

\emph{With this, the infinitesimal segment is the vector, which is what we want in the end. Question remains whether we can still use a chain rule formulation to derive this}

This gives us vectors and covectors: the former being infinitesimal segments, and the latter being functions from vectors to real numbers



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{vector} $v^1 \in V^1$ is an infinitesimal segment along a line. A \textbf{tangent plane}, then, is a collection of vectors that share a fixed point. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{covector} $\omega_1 : V^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear function of vectors. 
\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differential} $dx$ is the element of the tangent plane of a line which if summed at all points will return the line itself. 
\end{defn}

We can define functions that convert infinitesimal segments to a scalar value. 

For some line P, $\int df(P)$ = $\int \frac{\partial f(P)}{{\partial x^i}} dx^i$ = $\int \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial P}dP$ = $\int \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x^i}} e^i (dx^j e_j)$






\begin{prop}
	Every linear 1-functional has a corresponding covector, such that for $f : S \to \mathbb{R}$, $f = \int_{\lambda} \omega_1(d\lambda)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a line is the same as an integral of a covector over the infinitesimal segments of that line. 
\end{prop}





\section{K-vectors and K-forms}

\emph{Note that electrodynamics has been reworked in the language of k-vectors. Probably a good example to use}




\subsection{K-vectors}

- We want to be able to give a line, surface, body, etc. an orientation. This gives us k-vectors.

- Further, we're now talking about vectors and covectors in arbitrary dimensions

- Here we will be talking about wedge products, and how they behave with k-vectors of different degrees. 



\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-vector} $v^k \in V^k$ is an infinitesimal parallelepiped on a k-surface. A vector as discussed previously is a 1-vector. A \textbf{tangent space} is then a collection of k-vectors that share a fixed corner. 
\end{defn}

- \emph{Talking about orientation in terms of quantities: if we flip a quantity, we flip the orientation. Also, it should follow naturally that adding k-vectors of equal magnitude and opposite orientation will give zero.}



\begin{defn}
	$V^k$ is the set of all vectors of rank k and $V = \cup_{k=0}^n V^k$ is the set of all k-vectors. 
	\end{defn}



\begin{defn}
	
	The \textbf{wedge product} $\wedge : V^k\times V^j \to V^{k+j}$ combines k-vectors antisymmetrically to generate parallelepipeds. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The orientation of each side of the parallelepiped is different, as determined by the factors in the wedge product. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-form} $\omega_k : V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a skew-symmetric linear functional that converts an infinitesimal parallelepiped into a scalar value. A covector as discussed previously is a 1-form. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	$\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms of dimension k and $\Omega = \cup_{k=0}^n\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms. 
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
	Every linear k-functional has a corresponding k-form, such that for $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k = \int_{\sigma^k} \omega_k(d\sigma^k)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a k-surface is the same as an integral of a k-form over the infinitesimal parallelepipedes of that k-surface. 
\end{prop}

\section{Coordinates and components?}

Let $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment that starts at a point $P$. Then the coordinate differences $dx^i$ uniquely identifies $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $d\lambda = dx^i \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial x^i} = dx^i e_i$ where $e_i$ gives us the infinitesimal segment along the coordinate lines of $x^i$.

Let $\omega$ be a covector and $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment. Then $\omega(d\lambda)$ is a linear function of the coordinate differences along $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $\omega = \omega_i \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \lambda} = \omega_i e^i$ where each $e^i$ is the covector that returns the coordinate difference along the $x^i$ coordinate. In fact, $e^i(d\lambda) = e^i(dx^j e_j) = dx^j e^i(e_j) = dx^j \delta^i_j = dx^i$.


Therefore, for infinitesimal segment d$\lambda$ and k-form $\omega$, $\omega(d\lambda) = \omega_ie^i(dx^je_j) = \omega_idx^je^ie_j = \omega_idx^j\delta^i_j = \omega_i dx^i$ 

\section{Stoke's Theorem}



\begin{defn}
	$\eth : \Omega_k \to \Omega_{k+1}$ is the \textbf{exterior derivative} on k-forms, such that for k-surface $\sigma$ and (k-1)-functional $f$ with associated (k-1)-form $\omega$, 
	
	$f$($\sigma$) = $\int_{\sigma}\omega(d\sigma)$ and $\eth f(\sigma) = f(\partial\sigma)$
	
	$\implies \eth f(\sigma) = \int_{\partial\sigma} \omega(d\partial\sigma) = \int_{\sigma} \eth\omega(d\sigma)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	\textbf{Stoke's Theorem}: For (k-1)-form $\omega$ and k-surface $\sigma$, $\int_{\partial \sigma}\omega = \int_{\sigma}\eth\omega$. 
\end{defn}

NOTE: It seems that we don't even needs to worry about orientation as long as we're in coordinate free space. If possible, it would be cool to be able to not talk about orientation at all. It's just a choice of sign on both the direction of integration and the k-form. We can show that changing the sign of the integration necessitates also changing the sign of the k-form, thus making the orientation itself unnecessary (may not be needed). "suppose that you have a k-form, and you have chosen your coordinates, you can switch the order of integration and put a minus on the form, but then components of hte form change, so the form has different components dependign on orientation." "Or, we can say that there is some coordinate for which we go from a to be and others from b to a, components are thus the same, coordinates are different, but make up a class. It's just a different way to keep track of the sign." Components flip sign under a mirror, or flip, or whatever. 

NOTE: If we can stay coordinate free up until this point, maybe we can start talking about coordinates here in the coordinate transformation section
\section{Tensors and coordinate transformations}
Some quantities can undergo one-to-one transformations between coordinate systems. In general, such quantities are tensors. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{tensor} is an object with a one-to-one relationship with objects between coordinate systems. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as  $X'^a = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^b} X^b$.  
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A covariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as $X'_a = \frac{\partial x^b}{\partial x'^a} X_b$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 2} is a matrix $X^{ab}$ that transforms as $X'^{ab} = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^c} \frac{\partial x'^b}{\partial x^d} X^{cd}$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 0} is a quantity $X$ that transforms $X' = X$. Hence, a scalar. 
\end{coro}

- In general, objects associated with covariant tensors will have a lower index, and those associated with contravariant tensors will have an upper index.

\section{Symplectic geometry and state spaces}
We want to be able to represent our state configurations. Symplectic geometry arises when trying to describe their areas

\subsection{Symplectic form and areas}



\subsection{Metric tensor}
A more generalized inner product: feed in two vectors, and the outcome is a scalar representing the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{metric tensor g} is a function that takes two vectors and returns a real scalar. 
\end{defn}


\section{Riemannian geometry}
In order to give a mathematically rigorous definition of lengths of vectors and the angle between them, we use an inner product. Vector spaces with an inner product are Riemannian.

\begin{defn}
	Given two vectors $X^a,Y^a \in V$ and a metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the \textbf{inner product} $<X^a,Y^a> : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as $<X^a,Y^a> = g_{ab}X^aY^b$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The magnitude of $<u,v>$ is $|u||v|cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between u and v. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	If a vector space V contains an inner product, then V is \textbf{Riemannian}.
	\end{defn}



\subsection{Orthogonal basis}

\begin{defn}
	For contravariant vectors $X^a$ and $Y^a$, the two vectors are \textbf{orthogonal} if $<X^a,Y^b> = 0$. 
\end{defn}
