\section{Foreword}
In transitioning to more advanced classes, a physics student will find their familiar mathematical tools are inadequate to describe certain physical phenomena. The methods of traditional vector calculus in three dimensions, though very useful in electromagnetism and classical mechanics, are not always usable in higher dimensions, such as those used in general relativity and Hamiltonian mechanics. For that, we need differential geometry. When trying to learn a subject in mathematics, however, you tend to find books written for mathematicians, in a language that mathematicians are familiar with. As such, they are filled with long, obtuse definitions and prose that, while mathematically very precise, isn't exactly light reading, and can even be overkill for a proper physical understanding. 

What follows is a purely physical treatment of differential geometry used in physics. While it is less mathematically rigorous than a typical textbook, the hope is that the reader will be able to gain a geometric intuition for the math they use, so that the math isn't simply a black box beyond understanding, and that further study in the subject will be aided by a solid grounding here. The focus is always on readability, applicability, and physicality, so pictures are prevalent throughout. 

We assume on the part of the reader a class in introductory classical mechanics and electromagnetism, as well as vector calculus. More advanced topics in physics and mathematics may be briefly touched on, but only for the use of giving an example, or demonstrating the usefulness of these mathematical tools. 


\chapter{Mathematical representations of physical objects}



\section{Physical objects and quantities}

At the heart of scientific investigation is the identifying and organizing of objects based on their properties, through measurement and experiment. This could be anything from setting a block on a scale to determine its weight to determining the species that a particular animal belongs to. For our purposes here, we will be dealing only with properties that can be described using real numbers, such as mass, temperature, velocity, etc. The identification of a particular physical property with a real number is a \textbf{quantity}.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{quantity} is a function $q : U \to \mathbb{R}$ that assigns a measurable value to a physical case.
\end{defn}



It's quite possible, however, that we won't be able to distinguish between two objects with only one quantity. Say, for instance, that we're talking about weather. Knowing what the temperature will be tomorrow is certainly useful, but as anyone from Florida can tell you, 80$^o$F with 95$\%$ humidity is very different from 80$^o$F with 30$\%$ humidity. In distinguishing objects, then, we will often want to define more than one quantity, to give an even more descriptive way of categorizing objects. By defining enough quantities to distinguish one object from another, but not so many such that we have redundancies, we can define a \textbf{coordinate system}.


Normally, we think of coordinate systems in the context of quantifying an object's position, in terms of its x-, y-, and z-coordinates. Though it may be an abuse of terminology, we may use the same phrase to describe coordinates in other contexts. Consider, for instance, phase space. Configurations in phase space are fully characterized by position and momentum, which would be our two quantities, thus giving us a coordinate system. To give another example, we can look at a system described by the ideal gas law. With this, we would create a coordinate system with pressure, volume, and temperature. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate system} $Q$ is a collection of $n$ quantities $q^i : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that there is a one-to-one relationship between the physical objects in $U$ and elements of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}



With coordinate systems now defined, we recognize that in many instances, two different coordinate systems function just as well to describe a certain object. Mathematically, this occurs when two sets, each with defined coordinate systems, overlap. The points that lie within this overlapping section may be described in either coordinate system. To give an example from geography, consider an atlas of the world: a collection of maps. Depending on the atlas you're looking at, certain places may show up in multiple maps. Consider Moscow, for instance. It could very well show up on a map of Asia, perhaps in a square labeled B2, while also showing up on a map of Europe, perhaps in a square labeled C8. Either way of describing Moscow's position is equally valid, and you can freely "transform" between the coordinate systems as far as Moscow is concerned. Alternatively, consider the "point" Lisbon. Lisbon will show up on a map of Europe, perhaps in square F1, but you would never find Lisbon on a map of Asia. Therefore, its position may only be described in terms of the coordinates on the map of Europe.


\begin{defn}
	Given two coordinate systems  $Q : U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q' : V \to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$, we call a \textbf{coordinate transformation} the function $f = Q' \circ (Q)^{-1} : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}

Because of the poles, every location on Earth cannot be equally quantified with only one set of coordinates. This can be plainly seen on a typical flat map, such as a Mercator Projection. Land proportions grow the closer to a pole they are, making Greenland appear massive, and the Sahara proportionally far smaller. Furthermore, because the poles have been unraveled, in a sense, the South Pole, which ought to be a single point, is an entire line along the southern edge of the map. A proportionally accurate projection of the Earth onto a flat surface requires at least two separate maps. For instance, you could then have a map of the top hemisphere, centered at the north pole, and then of the bottom hemisphere, centered at the south pole. The Earth then motivates the introduction of the \textbf{manifold}. 


\textbf{Insert a picture of the Mercator Projection}

\textbf{Insert pictures of "polar" projections}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{manifold} is a set of physical objects $X$ such that for any $x \in X$ there exists a $U \subset X$ that contains $x$ and upon which a coordinate system $Q$ is defined. Manifolds have dimensionality, as determined by the dimension of their coordinate systems.
\end{defn}


Earlier, weather was given as an example of a set of possible cases of a system, with readings such as temperature and humidity allowing us to define a coordinate system. In this context, the "manifold" would be the set of possible weather configurations, with each point being a single weather report. Another example of a manifold would be the possible results of a blood drawing. The doctor takes your blood for analysis, the results of which are collected on a report, detailing things such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, white blood cell count, etc. Further examples include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The conditions of your car, with the dials on the dashboard being your method of reading them 

\item The freight on a ship, with the bill of lading detailing amounts

\item Any sort of information that can be condensed down to a series of real numbers

\end{itemize}

The variety of examples is to show the ubiquitousness of manifolds, and that they are very familiar, everyday objects. This versatility proves their usefulness in physics, and in scientific investigation in general. But unlike in the case of the Earth, manifolds do not in general come prepackaged with a notion of distance. What does it mean, for instance, for there to be distance between weather reports? Perhaps you can argue that distance comes into play by specifying where exactly the weather report was taken, but this is simply the geography example again under a different name. No, in order to define distance on our manifolds, we will need to wait until Chapter 3. 


\section{Sub-manifolds and k-surfaces}

Consider again the weather report example, where we are taking into account where exactly the report was taken. Perhaps we decide that we no longer care about what the actual weather reading is, instead worrying only about where we are. This takes us immediately from one example of a manifold to another, where the latter has fewer dimensions than the former, and where any point on the latter is also a point on the former. Thus, geography is a \textbf{submanifold} of the weather report.


\begin{defn}
	Consider a manifold X of dimension n, and a manifold Y of dimension k, such that $k \leq n$. Y is a \textbf{submanifold} or a \textbf{k-surface}\footnote{In general, we will be using the term "k-surface", instead of "submanifold." There will be many terms throughout this thesis prefaced by "k-". In general, this means that the object in question has k dimensions, and can be organized by the number of dimensions that they have.} of X if any point on Y is also a point on X. 
\end{defn}

\begin{tikzpicture}
[roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
\node[roundnode]	(X) {X};
\node[roundnode]	(Y) [below=of X]{Y};
\node[squarednode]	(realX) [right=of X] {$\mathbb{R}^n$};

\draw[<->] (X) -- (realX) node[midway, above] {$Q$};
\draw[->] (X) -- (Y) node[midway, left] {$U\cap V$};
\draw[<->] (Y) -- (realY) node[midway, below] {$P$};
\draw[->] (realU) -- (realV);
\end{tikzpicture}



\begin{defn}
	For some manifold X of dimension n, $S^k$ is the set of all possible \textbf{k-surfaces} of dimension $k \leq n$, and S $=$ $\cup^n_{k=0}S^k$ is the set of all surfaces. 
\end{defn}

We can go even further in our description of k-surfaces. If we assume that we can freely move through the entirety of the Earth's crust, but may not leave the surface of the Earth, we may say that the Earth manifold has a \textbf{boundary}, that being the surface of the Earth. Because radius is held fixed on the surface, the boundary of the Earth has a dimensionality of 2, instead of 3. 

\begin{defn}
	Given k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, the \textbf{boundary} of $\sigma^k$, denoted by $\partial\sigma^k \in S^{k-1}$ is the limit of varied coordinates. Points lying on the boundary are called \textbf{boundary points.}
\end{defn}

\textbf{Make this paragraph in terms of weather report first, and then do the math}
Though we can identify multiple quantities, it is still sometimes necessary to isolate specific quantities to identify their particular influence on a system. In an n-dimensional space, holding (n-1) quantities fixed and then allowing the nth quantity to vary would allow us to know specifically the effect that the nth quantity will have on the system. On our space, this varying quantity manifests itself as a line. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate line} is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by allowing one quantity to vary and holding the others fixed. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{coordinate k-surface} is the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ obtained by allowing k quantities to vary and holding (n-k) quantities fixed.  
\end{defn}


Now that we have k-surfaces, we have a notion of where points lie relative to some k-surface. When varying coordinates to creates coordinate lines, surfaces, volumes, etc., the varying can be brought to a halt by the geometry of the object that we're working on. Where the varying ends lies the \textbf{boundary} of our surface. 





Intuitively, we can talk about the boundary of a k-surface being a wall, beyond which a point confined to the k-surface cannot go. Consider, for instance, a particle confined to the inside of a sphere. The particle is free to move anywhere within the sphere, but is stopped from leaving by the surface of the sphere itself. Thus, the surface is the boundary. On the other hand, consider a particle confined to the surface of a sphere. The particle can travel along the surface as long as it wants without being stopped by any kind of wall. Thus, the surface of a sphere does not have a boundary. \textbf{Probably have a picture}

Later on, it will become important to be able to concentrate entirely on the boundary of a k-surface. Therefore, we must make use of the \textbf{boundary operator} in order to go from a k-surface to it's boundary. 

\begin{defn}
	For k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, the \textbf{boundary operator} $\partial : S^k \to S^{k-1}$ gives the set of boundary points of $\sigma^k$. 
\end{defn}



The dimension of the boundary is one less than the dimension of the k-surface itself. To get an intuitive feel for why this must be so, consider again a sphere embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For a particle confined to the inside of the sphere, the boundary would, again, be the surface of the sphere, as it blocks the particle from leaving. So, consider the particle confined to the sphere's boundary: its surface. When the particle is moving along the surface, the radius must be held fixed , so the dimension of the boundary of a set is one less than the dimension of the set. 

\textbf{include a picture here}


Furthermore, $\partial\partial \sigma^k$ is empty. Consider once again a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A particle confined to its surface can move in a straight line along the edge of the sphere forever, so there is no boundary. 

\emph{Being redundant in these past couple paragraphs. Get concise}

\begin{coro}
	Given $\sigma^k \in S^k$, $\partial \sigma^k \in S^{k-1}$, and $\partial\partial \sigma^k = \emptyset$. 
\end{coro}


\section{Linear Functionals of K-surfaces}

Say we have a path on our manifold (that is, a 1-surface), along which we want a particle to travel, and suppose we have a force in play with some sort of effect on the particle. We can define a work function which, with the aforementioned defined force, takes a path and returns the work (a scalar) necessary to move the particle along that path. Recalling any introductory course on classical mechanics, if the force is conservative (such as from gravity, or as from a spring), the work due to the force is path independent. That is, only the starting and ending points matter, and the specific path chosen is irrelevant. More concretely, say we have a line $\lambda$ with starting point $a$, ending point $c$, and some middle point $b$. Because our function is path independent, we can say that $W(\lambda_{a \to c}) = W(\lambda_{a \to b}) + W(\lambda_{b \to c})$. The work function is thus a linear function along a 1-surface: a \textbf{1-functional}. Furthermore, just as 1-surfaces are a specific subset of k-surfaces, we can say that 1-functionals are a specific subset of \textbf{k-functionals}. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{linear function of k-surfaces}, or \textbf{k-functional}, is a function $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ such that:
	
	I. for $\sigma^k_1$, $\sigma^k_2 \in S^k$, if $\sigma^k_1 \cap \sigma^k_2 \subseteq \partial \sigma^k_1 \cup \partial \sigma^k_2$, then $f_k(\sigma^k_1\cup \sigma^k_2) = f_k(\sigma^k_1) + f_k(\sigma^k_2)$; 
	
	II. $f_k$ commutes with the limit. That is, the limit of the function is the function of the limit. 
\end{defn}

\textbf{\emph{CAN'T HAVE AN INTEGRAL IN HERE. HAVE THE NONINFINITESIMAL EXAMPLE, OR JUST TAKE OUT}}
From this definition is something that perhaps isn't immediately intuitive: length is not a k-functional. Length L $= \int ds = \int \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$. This is clearly not a linear function, due to the square root. This comes from the infinitesimal segment of a curve $ds$ being made up of alternating horizontal and vertical infinitesimals $dx$ and $dy$. This is distinct from the limit of length L $= \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Simply put, the length of the limit is not the same thing as the limit of the length. 


\begin{defn}
	$F_k$ is the set of all functionals of dimension k, and $F = \cup_{k=0}^nF_k$ is the set of all functionals. 
\end{defn}


In the previous section, we discussed the boundary operator as a map from a k-surface to its boundary. We can similarly create an operator that takes a k-functional and makes it apply to a (k+1)-surface. In complement to "boundary operator", we define the \textbf{boundary functional} as the operator on k-functionals that forces the k-functional to act only on the boundary of the k-surface. 

\begin{defn}
	$\eth : F_k \to F_{k+1}$ such that $\eth f_k(\sigma^{k+1}) = f_k(\partial \sigma^{k+1})$ is the \textbf{boundary functional} on k-functionals. 
\end{defn}

Further properties of the boundary functional arise due to its relationship with the boundary operator.


\begin{prop}
	A k-functional applied to the empty set gives zero. \textbf{\textit{Don't give a proof, give a justification}}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	
	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear function. Consider the empty set $\emptyset$. 
We have $\emptyset \cap \emptyset \subseteq \partial\emptyset \cup \partial\emptyset$, and $\emptyset = \emptyset\cup\emptyset$. 
So, $f_k(\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset\cup\emptyset) = f_k(\emptyset) + f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 2f_k(\emptyset) \implies f_k(\emptyset) = 0$
\end{proof}



\begin{prop}
	Let $f_k \in F_k$ be a k-functional, then $\eth\eth f_k = 0 $. \textbf{\textit{Don't give a proof, give a justification}}
	
	
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

	Let $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $g_{k+1} : S^{k+1} \to \mathbb{R},$ and $h_{k+2}: S^{k+2} \to \mathbb{R}$ be linear functions, and let $\sigma^k$ be an element of $S^k$. $f_k(\sigma^k) = g_{k+1}(\partial \sigma^k) = h_{k+2}(\partial\partial \sigma^k) = f_k(\emptyset) = 0$. 
	
	So, $h^{k+2}(s) = 0$ $\forall$ $\sigma^k$, and $h^{k+2}$ is the zero function. 
\end{proof}

\section{Summary}


In this first section, we've laid the groundwork for a physical treatment of differential geometry. By starting with the idea of distinguishing objects through quantities, we are quickly able to come to an intuitive understanding of manifolds. We see also that a purely physically motivated form of differential geometry is possible, which will be further confirmed in the coming chapters. 


\chapter{Mathematical representation of infinitesimal objects}


\section{Differentiable manifolds}

In the previous section, we began to discuss functionals applied over k-surfaces one after the other. With the rules we've already established, we can break up a k-surface into multiple sections, such that applying a functional over the entire surface is equivalent to applying it to each of the sections individually, and then summing their contributions. What if we could make these sections infinitesimally small? How would our manifolds behave, and furthermore, what happens to the functionals?

Consider now a k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$, with a k-functional $f_k$. We can break this surface up into "n" number of parts, called $\sigma^k_1, \sigma^k_2, ..., \sigma^k_n$. We know that $f_k(\sigma^k) = f_k(\sigma^k_1) + f_k(\sigma^k_2) + ... + f_k(\sigma^k_n) = \Sigma^n_if_k(\sigma^k_i)$. If we let n tend to infinity, the parts become infinitesimal. Summing the contributions of the infinitesimals is equivalent to an integral of the function over the whole surface. So, for k-surface $\sigma^k \in S^k$ and k-functional $f_k: S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k(\sigma^k) = \int_{\sigma^k}\omega_k(d\sigma^k)$ for some yet undefined function $\omega_k$. The existence of infinitesimals on our manifolds allows us to perform. Such manifolds are \textbf{differentiable manifolds}. 

Technically speaking, differentiability is a property not of the manifold, but of the coordinate systems that are defined on it. And furthermore, not every coordinate system is differentiable. In order to maintain differentiability on our manifolds, we will be constraining ourselves to coordinate systems which are differentiable. Essentially, what we're doing here is looking at an entire manifold, with all of its constituent subsections and thereon defined coordinate systems, and disregarding the coordinate systems that are not differentiable. This property manifests itself as the coordinate transformation between subsets of the manifold being smooth. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{differentiable manifold} is a manifold $X$ of dimension $n$ such that if there are overlapping subsets $U$ and $V$ with defined coordinate systems $Q: U \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $Q': V \to \mathbb{R}^n$, then the coordinate transformation $f = Q \circ Q'^{-1}$ is smooth. 
\end{defn}





\section{Vectors and Covectors}


This section and the next will be focusing on the formalism of functions over infinitesimals. Here we will be starting with the k = 1 case, and seeing what mathematical tools naturally arise. In the next section, we will be moving to the general k case, and seeing how the math here in turn generalizes. 

Say we are given a line (that is, a 1-surface), and we want to apply a 1-functional over it to get some appropriate real number quantity. We are able to say that applying a 1-functional over a line is equivalent to breaking up that line into smaller line segments, applying the functional over the segments separately, and summing the individual contributions. Because we are now dealing with differentiable manifolds, we are able to shrink those segments down to infinitesimal sizes. 




An infinitesimal plus an infinitesimal is still an infinitesimal. While the length of a diagonal line segment is different from the length of a horizontal segment plus a vertical segment, in the limit as the segments become infinitesimal, the diagonal will converge with the horizontal and vertical. We say, then, that the infinitesimals form a vector space, the elements of which are called \textbf{vectors}. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{vector} $v^1 \in V^1$ is an infinitesimal segment along a line. A \textbf{tangent plane}, then, is a collection of vectors that share a fixed point. 
\end{defn}

Just as our segments have become infinitesimal, the functionals acting on them become in a sense infinitesimal as well. A linear function on vectors that returns a real number is a \textbf{covector}.

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{covector} $\omega_1 : V^1 \to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear function of vectors. 
\end{defn}




We have now a conceptual relationship between functionals over surfaces, and infinitesimal functions over infinitesimal segments. The infinitesimal objects may be related to their massive counterparts using integration, providing physical relationships that are already familiar to us. Recall the example of work given in section 1.3, and let $W \in F_1$ be a work function. You give the function a line, and it returns the work necessary to move an object along that line. So, following the formalism described earlier, given $\lambda \in S^1$, we can say that $W(\lambda) = \int \omega(d\lambda)$ for some covector $\omega$. This covector is simply a force. Concretely, consider a spring with spring constant $k$ and a mass $m$ attached to the end, oscillating without drag. The work necessary to pull the mass from the point $x = a$ to $x = b$ (being the starting and ending points of the line $\lambda$) is $W(\lambda) = W(b) - W(a) = \int_a^b -kx dx$. The force (the covector) is $-kx$, and the infinitesimal segment (the vector) is $dx$.

\draw[<-] (r) -- (v) node[midway, right] {$\omega_1$};
\draw[->] (s) -- (r) node[midway, left] {$f_1$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{prop}
	All linear 1-functionals have a corresponding covector, such that for $f : S \to \mathbb{R}$, $f = \int_{\lambda} \omega_1(d\lambda)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a line is the same as an integral of a covector over the infinitesimal segments of that line. 
\end{prop}




\section{K-vectors and K-forms}


Conceptually, this section will be an expansion and generalization of the previous section. Whereas before we were only worrying about 1-surfaces and 1-functionals, now we will be going up to the general k-surfaces and k-functionals. The "k" refers to the number of degrees of freedom of the surface or functional. 

Using line segments as our infinitesimal elements now is no longer sufficient on a k-surface. At this point, we must make use of infinitesimal \emph{parallelepipeds}: a 3D shape whose sides are paralellograms. Whereas before when the line segments would be stuck end-to-end, the parallelepipeds will be stuck side-to-side, such that one side of one parallelepiped makes up one side of the other. These infinitesimal parallelepipeds form a vector space of degree k, the elements of which are called \textbf{k-vectors}. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-vector} $v^k \in V^k$ is an infinitesimal parallelepiped on a k-surface. A vector as discussed previously is a 1-vector. A \textbf{tangent space} is then a collection of k-vectors that share a fixed corner. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	$V^k$ is the set of all vectors of rank k and $V = \cup_{k=0}^n V^k$ is the set of all vectors. 
	\end{defn}

Parallelepipeds are 3D objects, more flexible than a cube, whose sides are parallelograms, which are in turn more flexible than squares. In general, an infinitesimal piece on a k-surface will take the form of a paralellepiped. In the case of k = 1, an infinitesimal segment of a line may be thought of as a parallelepiped without width or heighth. By that same thinking, when k = 2, an infinitesimal area on a 2-surface may be thought of as a parallelepiped without height. 




\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{k-form} $\omega_k : V^k \to \mathbb{R}$ is a linear functional that converts an infinitesimal parallelepiped into a scalar value. A covector as discussed previously is a 1-form. 
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}
	$\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms of dimension k and $\Omega = \cup_{k=0}^n\Omega_k$ is the set of all forms. 
\end{defn}


Consider an x-y coordinate plane, with x in the horizontal direction and y in the vertical direction. The coordinate system may be rotated freely (creating an equivalence class of directions), but try swapping x and y, so that x is now vertical and y is now horizontal. The original coordinate system can no longer be reached simply through rotation; it would require a flipping of one of the axes. 
\textbf{Probably put a picture of that here}



\begin{defn}
	
	The \textbf{wedge product} $\wedge : V^k\times V^j \to V^{k+j}$ combines k-vectors antisymmetrically to generate parallelepipeds. 
\end{defn}

It may seem that the cross product in multivariable calculus and the wedge product are the same thing, but this is not the case. (\textbf{Here we can talk about perpendicular as the difference between cross and wedge, talking aobut how the cross product doesn't generalize, since in 4D for instance there isn't only one perpendicular. So wedge is better. Cross also needs a notion of angles, such as on riemannian manifold, which is less general})

\begin{coro}
	The orientation of each side of the parallelepiped is different, as determined by the factors in the wedge product. 
\end{coro}


(\textbf{Introduce a wedge product for k-forms. don't talk about it until after propositoin 2.12. Keep it the same structure as the previous section})



To finish up the generalization of the previous section, we establish the relationship between k-functionals and k-forms, between k-surfaces and k-vectors. The latter two are infinitesimal variants of the former two, and are related to one another by an integral. 

\begin{prop}
	Every linear k-functional has a corresponding k-form, such that for $f_k : S^k \to \mathbb{R}$, $f_k = \int_{\sigma^k} \omega_k(d\sigma^k)$. In words, a linear functional applied over a k-surface is the same as an integral of a k-form over the infinitesimal parallelepipedes of that k-surface. 
\end{prop}

\textbf{(Make a note that the vector has an orientation, and it's associated with the order of integration. Flipping the integral is the same as getting a minus sign on the vector.)}

\section{Coordinates and Components} 

(\textbf{Talk about differential elements here, not up above})

NOTE: Will have to talk about what the basis is. We start by saying that in a neighborhood we have a coordinate system, and that coordinate system can be used to identify the components of the vectors and components of the covectors. Also probably talk about how to make the wedge product with the components, and how to talk about the exterior derivative

A conceptual understanding of vectors and covectors, and of k-forms and k-vectors is found well enough in general coordinate-free form. By not specifying exactly what coordinate system or frame of reference we are in, we are able to find universal relationships between our mathematical tools. The caveat to this is that coordinate-free form often isn't terribly useful for solving actual problems in physics. In this section, then, we will be concerned with 

Let $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment that starts at a point $P$. Then the coordinate differences $dx^i$ uniquely identifies $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $d\lambda = dx^i \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial x^i} = dx^i e_i$ where $e_i$ gives us the infinitesimal segment along the coordinate lines of $x^i$.

Let $\omega$ be a covector and $d\lambda$ be an infinitesimal segment. Then $\omega(d\lambda)$ is a linear function of the coordinate differences along $d\lambda$. Therefore we can write $\omega = \omega_i \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial \lambda} = \omega_i e^i$ where each $e^i$ is the covector that returns the coordinate difference along the $x^i$ coordinate. In fact, $e^i(d\lambda) = e^i(dx^j e_j) = dx^j e^i(e_j) = dx^j \delta^i_j = dx^i$.


Therefore, for infinitesimal segment d$\lambda$ and k-form $\omega$, $\omega(d\lambda) = \omega_ie^i(dx^je_j) = \omega_idx^je^ie_j = \omega_idx^j\delta^i_j = \omega_i dx^i$ 


\underline{\textbf{PUT MATH STUFF DOWN HERE FOR NOW}}

Consider a line P, with 1-functional $f$. $ df(P)$ = $ \frac{\partial f(P)}{{\partial x^i}} dx^i$ = $ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial P}dP$ = $\frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x^i}} e^i (dx^j e_j)$. 

A single point along the line P is P($x^a$). Infinitesimally, we may write that  
$dP(x^a) = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a} dx^a = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^b} dx^b = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x^a}\frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b} dx^b$

$\implies dx^a = \frac{\partial x^a}{\partial x^b}dx^b $

For some line P, $\int df(P)$ = $\int \frac{\partial f(P)}{{\partial x^i}} dx^i$ = $\int \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^i}\frac{\partial x^i}{\partial P}dP$ = $\int \frac{{\partial f}}{{\partial x^i}} e^i (dx^j e_j)$
\section{Stoke's Theorem}



\begin{defn}
	$\eth : \Omega_k \to \Omega_{k+1}$ is the \textbf{exterior derivative} on k-forms, such that for k-surface $\sigma$ and (k-1)-functional $f$ with associated (k-1)-form $\omega$, 
	
	$f$($\sigma$) = $\int_{\sigma}\omega(d\sigma)$ and $\eth f(\sigma) = f(\partial\sigma)$
	
	$\implies \eth f(\sigma) = \int_{\partial\sigma} \omega(d\partial\sigma) = \int_{\sigma} \eth\omega(d\sigma)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	\textbf{Stoke's Theorem}: For (k-1)-form $\omega$ and k-surface $\sigma$, $\int_{\partial \sigma}\omega = \int_{\sigma}\eth\omega$. 
\end{defn}

NOTE: It seems that we don't even needs to worry about orientation as long as we're in coordinate free space. If possible, it would be cool to be able to not talk about orientation at all. It's just a choice of sign on both the direction of integration and the k-form. We can show that changing the sign of the integration necessitates also changing the sign of the k-form, thus making the orientation itself unnecessary (may not be needed). "suppose that you have a k-form, and you have chosen your coordinates, you can switch the order of integration and put a minus on the form, but then components of hte form change, so the form has different components dependign on orientation." "Or, we can say that there is some coordinate for which we go from a to be and others from b to a, components are thus the same, coordinates are different, but make up a class. It's just a different way to keep track of the sign." Components flip sign under a mirror, or flip, or whatever. 

NOTE: If we can stay coordinate free up until this point, maybe we can start talking about coordinates here in the coordinate transformation section
\section{Tensors and coordinate transformations}
Some quantities can undergo one-to-one transformations between coordinate systems. In general, such quantities are tensors. 

NOTES on tensors: Talking about tensors as multilinear maps makes it so that vectors and momentum would be treated as functions, which doesn't really make sense. It may be interesting to explicitally mention this problem, while defining tensors in terms of how they transform. 


\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{tensor} is an object with a one-to-one relationship with objects between coordinate systems. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as  $X'^a = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^b} X^b$.  
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A covariant tensor of \textbf{rank 1} is a vector, which transforms as $X'_a = \frac{\partial x^b}{\partial x'^a} X_b$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 2} is a matrix $X^{ab}$ that transforms as $X'^{ab} = \frac{\partial x'^a}{\partial x^c} \frac{\partial x'^b}{\partial x^d} X^{cd}$. 
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
	A contravariant tensor of \textbf{rank 0} is a quantity $X$ that transforms $X' = X$. Hence, a scalar. 
\end{coro}

- In general, objects associated with covariant tensors will have a lower index, and those associated with contravariant tensors will have an upper index. 












\chapter{Geometry and (States, Tensors, Forms)???}

\emph{Two types of geometry: symplectic which only has 2D areas, and riemannian which has length and angles}


\section{Symplectic geometry and state spaces}
We want to be able to represent our state configurations. Symplectic geometry arises when trying to describe their areas

\subsection{Symplectic form and areas}



\subsection{Metric tensor}
A more generalized inner product: feed in two vectors, and the outcome is a scalar representing the lengths of the vectors and the angle between them. 

\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{metric tensor g} is a function that takes two vectors and returns a real scalar. 
\end{defn}


\section{Riemannian geometry}
In order to give a mathematically rigorous definition of lengths of vectors and the angle between them, we use an inner product. Vector spaces with an inner product are Riemannian.

\begin{defn}
	Given two vectors $X^a,Y^a \in V$ and a metric tensor $g_{ab}$, the \textbf{inner product} $<X^a,Y^a> : V \times V \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as $<X^a,Y^a> = g_{ab}X^aY^b$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{coro}
	The magnitude of $<u,v>$ is $|u||v|cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between u and v. 
\end{coro}

\begin{defn}
	If a vector space V contains an inner product, then V is \textbf{Riemannian}.
	\end{defn}



\subsection{Orthogonal basis}

\begin{defn}
	For contravariant vectors $X^a$ and $Y^a$, the two vectors are \textbf{orthogonal} if $<X^a,Y^b> = 0$. 
\end{defn}
